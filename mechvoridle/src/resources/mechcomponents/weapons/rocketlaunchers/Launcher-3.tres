description = "Thy-Kingdom-Come is one of the most powerful rocket launchers Crosshair Enterprises has developed - although, it is highly experimental leading to usage difficulty.

This launcher typically requires a heavier mech frame to utilize effectively and a trained mech pilot for volatile conditions. 

Great for those who prefer high-risk high reward, and when we say high-risk/reward - the effects are devastating."
